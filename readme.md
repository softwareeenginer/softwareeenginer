  Hello!
I'm twenty and I'm from Turkey. When I was a child I wanted to be a software engineer.
And I'm here, now. Like other people, I went to primary, middle, and high school. At the moment I'm studying at Fırat University - Third grade.
Professional life idea:
Believe in yourself. While in high school ( I'm talking about ninth grade.) I played SAMP (San Andreas Multiplayer), I reviewed source codes of the game and HTML codes of the website. Then I looked at the code and I started to love this. I just know this: Do the job you love! Life is short and beautiful things are very few. ' Just Do It! '
